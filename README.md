This is a python wrapper around [libfes-lite](https://github.com/cbouilla/libfes-lite).

libfes-lite contains highly optimized C/assembler kernels to solve quadratic
boolean systems of (at most) 32 equations in (at most) 32 variables. This
python wrapper makes it much easier to use this high-performance code.
